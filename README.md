# Albanian Dev Connector

> Social network for developers

This is a application created as a school project.
The idea is to create a wide albanian developer community that can help each other or exchange ideas or experiences. It's kind of a profesional social network. The concept was to be something between stackoverflow and LinkedIn.
If you want to contribute please feel free to create new branches or to fork the project and keep making it better.
Maybe one day this will be the biggest Developer Community in Albania!
